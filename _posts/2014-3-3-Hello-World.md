title: How to buy your first bicycle in San Francisco
---

When I graduated from school, I took a train trip around the country. Initially I was just trying to survey the modern city, but realizing I had nothing tying me down to my home in Virginia, I thought it would be better to start surveying them for livability. Main thing I was looking for: a bike-friendly city. (Also good selfie shots)

Go to Columbus Cyclerly on any day excluding Sunday. Ask for Abel. Buy bicycle.
