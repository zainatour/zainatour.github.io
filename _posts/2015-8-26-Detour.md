title: A review of Detour, a location-aware audio app
---

My first experience with Detour was a couple weeks ago, when a friend invited me to go on one with him. I'd heard about Detour via FastCompany, but had never went on one. As someone who majored in urban planning, I was very excited to see what was in store.

This particular tour, Cool Gray City, was free due to a special event, but normally they cost $5. I met up with my friends at the Transamerica Pyramid, where the tour began. When my party of 2 had arrived, we were able to sync our phones with one another via the app such that when one person paused the tour, it paused for everyone. This feature alone is *amazing*. I've been on audio tours before at various places with family - Alcatraz, art museums - everyone started and ended at different times, got lost and it was kiiind of a disaster. But on the Detour, everyone purposefully stayed together because the experience is so intimate. The tour has funny, bizarre, and just plain interesting moments; to know for sure that everyone else you are listening with is hearing the same thing as you at exactly the same time made it so much fun! You all laugh or hide from the mammoths at the same time which contribute to a very unique experience.

Additionally, Detour is location-aware, meaning it will a.) give you specific directions about how to get to the next checkpoint and b.) play filler music until you get there (this is especially delightful). These things ensure you never have to pause the tour and that you won't get lost. It gives you very specific directions (walk 50 feet, then take a left) with a small compass and you can always reference a map of the full tour.

Lastly, the content is exquisite. Having lived in SF for almost a year now, I discovered things about various neighborhoods and landmarks that I would've never stumbled upon or learned otherwise. San Francisco is a rather historic place! Plus, the tour delves into the current state of the neighborhood and the accuracy of the words are astonishing. For example, you're walking through Chinatown and the app will say "....there are people all over this park playing chinese checkers and cards.." and you look to your left and right, and indeed! there are people everywhere playing chinese checkers and cards. Such lovely attention to detail.

I went on my second Detour not too long after my first, where I learned about the flowers and plants in Golden Gate Park. Gerald Ford was a dahlia enthusiast. Who knew?
