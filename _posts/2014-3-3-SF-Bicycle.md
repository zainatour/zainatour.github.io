title: How to buy your first (road) bicycle in San Francisco
---

When I graduated from school, I took a train trip around the country. Initially I was just trying to survey the modern city, but after realizing I had nothing tying me down to my home in Virginia, I thought it would be better to start surveying them for livability. Main thing I was looking for: a bike-friendly city. (Also good selfie shots)

Truthfully, I had settled on San Francisco a few months prior. It has the best weather (especially for biking) and scenery like nothing I'd ever seen on the east coast. After my adventures ended in SF, I was around for a couple of weeks before I decided to buy a bicycle. My parents were skeptical because I wasn't employed (yet!), but I was spending a lot of money on transportation and I don't *love* MUNI or bart.

My first bike was a [Public bike](http://publicbikes.com/p/PUBLIC-V7-2015-Best-City-Bike-Commuter-Cruiser-Bicycle-Reviews). It was $500 and quite tacky and after riding it for five months and finding a job, I suddenly started to dislike the thing. I wasn't excited about riding it and thought it was garish. It was also realllly heavy which I did not need with all the hills everywhere. And so began the hunt for a road bike. It took me ~a month total because there were zero resources anywhere on how to go about buying a road bicycle in the city. So I made one! My experience is mostly with road bikes, but this can be used for other kinds too.

Your goal:
-buy a bicycle that you enjoy riding*
-don't spend a ton of money** 

*This is by far the most important thing. If you don't absolutely love your bike, you're going to find excuses to not use it.

**You should expect to spend somewhere between $400-$600 on a bicycle and $100 in safety and security. This is 100% doable. I did it this weekend! Anything less will be sort of hard, but certainly not impossible.

Places to look for a used bicycle:
*[Columbus Cyclery](http://www.gobikeit.com/cyclery/buy-a-bike/used-bikes/) definitely has the largest in-person selection. Go here first, but beware since some of their bikes have parts that don't necessarily go together. A guy named Abel works here every day except Sunday. He's *amazing* - ask for him!
*[Craigslist](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/bik) time consuming, but very worth it and lots and lots of bikes. Buy cheap and get it fixed up.
*[Refried Cycles](http://www.refriedcycles.com/) wonderful used bikes but not a lot of selection and sort of expensive.
*[Pedal Revolution](http://www.pedalrevolution.org/) less expensive but less selection.
*[Lulu's Cyclery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/lulus-cyclery-berkeley) decent selection, but in Berkeley.

If you are short (5'5 and below), you should call ahead of time to ask about what bikes they have for small people. It's often hard to find bikes if you are shorter. The best place to go if you are small is craigslist.

What to look for:
-the right size
	-bicycles are measured in centimeters, the length of the top tube. If this distance is too long, the bike will be difficult/impossible to ride.
	-when you stand over the bicycle, you should have a bit of room between your crotch and the tube. 
-a smooth ride. it should switch gears without issue and be generally easy for you to operate.
	-gears are located in one of three places:
		-on the down tube
			-less intuitive at first, but you pick it up quickly 
		-on the brakes
		-at the end of the handlebars
	-some gears are "indexed" and others are "friction"
		-think of a gas stove. when you turn on the fire, you can move it between high, medium, or low, but it can only be in those three settings. this is what indexed gears are.
		-when you turn on the fire, you can move it anywhere between high and low with a ton of range in between. this is what friction gears are.


Finding the right bicycle is mostly about intuition. Does it feel nice when you pedal and switch gears or is it hard to operate? Do you enjoy riding it or do you wish something were different about it? Do you like the way it looks or do you not care?
